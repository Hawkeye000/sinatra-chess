Sinatra Chess
=============

This project uses the libraries developed in "Command Line Chess" to bring chess to life on the Web using the Sinatra DSL.

See this project in action at http://hawkeye-chess.herokuapp.com/.

Making Moves
------------
Moves can be made by clicking a piece and selecting a square to move it to. Selecting the original square will deselect that piece and allow selecting another piece.  

Make a Castling move by placing the king in its "after-castling" position.  For example, if white were to make a king-side castle, it would move the King from "E1" to "G1".
